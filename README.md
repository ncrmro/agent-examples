# Agent Examples
For the next seven days, my goal is to build an Assistant that utilizes an interesting tool.

## Day 2 [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

The Meal DB is a pretty inflexible API allowing you to search the title of a recipe, category, or single ingredient.

The assistant works pretty well even when it initially doesn't find results. After giving it a hint, if no results are found, try searching one word at a time.

From the initial search, we return only the ID and meal name separated by a pipe and then a comma between meals, keeping the token count low.

The assistant can then pull the rest of the recipe once it finds a good match. Allowing it to specify a category did have it try and make multiple searches but ultimately confused it more.

* Chicken Fried Steak or cornbread didn't return anything from the database.
* Generic queries like "I need to do something with this shrimp" or "my kids want pancakes."

Lastly, I updated its prompt instructing it to improvise a recipe if none was found.

## Day 1 [Open Street Map Restaurant Finder](0-openstreet-map.rb)

This assistant uses the Open Street Map [OverPass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) to search for restaurants of various cuisines in a city.

Initially, I attempted to create a single OverPass Query to search for multiple cuisines, but the langchain ended up making three separate tool calls to the Overpass API (which was good enough at 11:30 at night.
